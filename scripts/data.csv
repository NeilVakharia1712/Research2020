Write a multithreaded application that emulates a broker-based pub/sub system. Publisher and subscriber threads may communicate with the broker via (shared) memory. Each message should start with a length field followed by that many characters. Publishers send messages to the broker where the first line of the message contains a hierarchical subject line separated by dots followed by one or more lines that comprise the published article. Subscribers send a message to the broker with a single line containing a hierarchical interest line separated by dots expressing the articles they are interested in. The interest line may contain the wildcard symbol ‘‘*’’. The broker must respond by sending all (past) articles that match the subscriber’s interest. Articles in the message are separated by the line ‘‘BEGIN NEW ARTICLE.’’ The subscriber should print each message it receives along with its subscriber identity (i.e., its interest line). The subscriber should continue to receive any new articles that are posted and match its interests. Publisher and subscriber threads can be created dynamically from the terminal by typing ‘‘P’’ or ‘‘S’’ (for publisher or subscriber) followed by the hierarchical subject/interest line. Publishers will then prompt for the article. Typing a single line containing ‘‘.’’ will signal the end of the article. (This project can also be implemented using processes communicating via TCP.)",en,,8,34
general,0,An Evaluation of Load Balancing Algorithms for Distributed ...,https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/4395/1/uk_bl_ethos_305426.pdf,etheses.whiterose.ac.uk › uk_bl_ethos_305426,,9,"Write a program that implements the sender-initiated and receiver-initiated load balancing algorithms described in Sec. 8.2. The algorithms should take as input a list of newly created jobs specified as (creating processor, start time, required CPU time) where the creating processor is the number of the CPU that created the job, the start time is the time at which the job was created, and the required CPU time is the amount of CPU time the job needs to complete (specified in seconds). Assume a node is overloaded when it has one job and a second job is created. Assume a node is underloaded when it has no jobs. Print the number of probe messages sent by both algorithms under heavy and light workloads. Also print the maximum and minimum number of probes sent by any host and received by any host. To create the workloads, write two workload generators. The first should simulate a heavy workload, generating, on average, N jobs every AJL seconds, where AJL is the average job length and N is the number of processors. Job lengths can be a mix of long and short jobs, but the av erage job length must be AJL. The jobs should be randomly created (placed) across all processors. The second generator should simulate a light load, randomly generating N/3 jobs every AJL seconds. Play with other parameter settings for the workload generators and see how it affects the number of probe messages. 38. One of the simplest ways to implement a publish/subscribe system is via a centralized broker that receives published articles and distributes them to the appropriate subscribers. Write a multithreaded application that emulates a broker-based pub/sub system. Publisher and subscriber threads may communicate with the broker via (shared) memory. Each message should start with a length field followed by that many characters. Publishers send messages to the broker where the first line of the message contains a hierarchical subject line separated by dots followed by one or more lines that comprise the published article. Subscribers send a message to the broker with a single line containing a hierarchical interest line separated by dots expressing the articles they are interested in. The interest line may contain the wildcard symbol ‘‘*’’. The broker must respond by sending all (past) articles that match the subscriber’s interest. Articles in the message are separated by the line ‘‘BEGIN NEW ARTICLE.’’ The subscriber should print each message it receives along with its subscriber identity (i.e., its interest line). The subscriber should continue to receive any new articles that are posted and match its interests. Publisher and subscriber threads can be created dynamically from the terminal by typing ‘‘P’’ or ‘‘S’’ (for publisher or subscriber) followed by the hierarchical subject/interest line. Publishers will then prompt for the article. Typing a single line containing ‘‘.’’ will signal the end of the article.
