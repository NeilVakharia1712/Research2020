Exercise 1.5

Exercise 1.5.1. 
Finish the following proof for Theorem 1.5.7.Assume B is a countable set. Thus, there exists f : N → B, which is 1–1 and onto. Let A ⊆ B be an infinite subset of B. We must show that A is countable.Let n1 = min{n ∈ N : f(n) ∈ A}. As a start to a definition of g : N → A, set g(1) = f(n1). Show how to inductively continue this process to produce a 1–1 function g from N onto A.

Exercise 1.5.3. 
Use the following outline to supply proofs for the statementsin Theorem 1.5.8.(a) Prove that If A1,A2, . . . Am are each countable sets, then the union A1 ∪ A2 ∪ · · ·∪ Am is countable for two countable sets(b) Explain why induction cannot be used to prove if An is a countable set for each n ∈ N, then Union An for n = 1 to infinity is countable.
(c) Show how arranging N into the two-dimensional array leads us to the proof If A1,A2, . . . Am are each countable sets, then the union A1 ∪ A2 ∪ · · · ∪ Am is countable and If An is a countable set for each n ∈ N, then Union An is countable.

Exercise 1.5.4
(a) Show (a, b) ∼ R for any interval (a, b).(b) Show that an unbounded interval like (a,∞) = {x : x > a} has the same cardinality as R as well.(c) Using open intervals makes it more convenient to produce the required 1–1, onto functions, but it is not really necessary. Show that [0, 1) ∼ (0, 1) by exhibiting a 1–1 onto function between the two sets.

Exercise 1.5.5. 
(a) Why is A ∼ A for every set A?(b) Given sets A and B, explain why A ∼ B is equivalent to asserting B ∼ A.(c) For three sets A,B, and C, show that A ∼ B and B ∼ C implies A ∼ C. These three properties are what is meant by saying that ∼ is an equivalence relation.


Exercise 1.5.6. 
(a) Give an example of a countable collection of disjoint open intervals.(b) Give an example of an uncountable collection of disjoint open intervals,or argue that no such collection exists.

Exercise 1.5.7. 
Consider the open interval (0,1), and let S be the set of points in the open unit square; that is, S = {(x, y) : 0 < x,y < 1}.(a) Find a 1–1 function that maps (0, 1) into, but not necessarily onto, S.(b) Use the fact that every real number has a decimal expansion to produce a 1–1 function that maps S into (0, 1). Discuss whether the formulated function is onto. (Keep in mind that any terminating decimal

Exercise 1.5.8. 
Let B be a set of positive real numbers with the property that adding together any finite subset of elements from B always gives a sum of 2 or less. Show B must be finite or countable.

Exercise 1.5.9. (a) Show that sqrt(2), cuberoot(2) and (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) are algebraic. (b) Fix n ∈ N, and let An be the algebraic numbers obtained as roots of polynomials with integer coefficients that have degree n. Using the fact that every polynomial has a finite number of roots, show that An is countable.(c) Now, argue that the set of all algebraic numbers is countable. What may we conclude about the set of transcendental numbers?

Exercise 1.5.10. 
(a) Let C ⊆ [0, 1] be uncountable. Show that there exists a ∈ (0, 1) such that C ∩ [a, 1] is uncountable.(b) Now let A be the set of all a ∈ (0, 1) such that C ∩ [a, 1] is uncountable, and set α = supA. Is C ∩ [α, 1] an uncountable set?(c) Let C ⊆ [0, 1] be infinite. Can that there exists a ∈ (0, 1) such that C ∩ [a, 1] is infinite.

Exercise 1.5.11 (
Schroder–Bernstein Theorem). Assume there exists a 1–1 function f : X → Y and another 1–1 function g : Y → X. Follow the steps to show that there exists a 1–1, onto function h : X → Y and hence X ∼ Y . The strategy is to partition X and Y into components X = A ∪ A' and Y = B ∪ B'with A ∩ A' = ∅ and B ∩ B' = ∅, in such a way that f maps A onto B, and g maps B' onto A'.(a) Explain how achieving this would lead to a proof that X ∼ Y .(b) Set A1 = X\g(Y ) = {x ∈ X : x /∈ g(Y )} (what happens if A1 = ∅?) and inductively define a sequence of sets by letting An+1 = g(f(An)). Show that {An : n ∈ N} is a pairwise disjoint collection of subsets of X, while {f(An) : n ∈ N} is a similar collection in Y .(d) Let A = X\A and B = Y \B. Show g maps B onto A.
