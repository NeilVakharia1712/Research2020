Exercise 2.7.3
Provide the details for the proof of the Comparison Test using the Cauchy Criterion for Series.Give another proof for the Comparison Test, this time using the Monotone Convergence Theorem.

Exercise 2.7.4

Give an example of each or explain why the request is impossible referencing the proper theorem(s).Two series sum(xn) and sum(yn) that both diverge but where sum(xnyn) converges.A convergent series sum(xn) and a bounded sequence (yn) such that sum(xnyn)diverges.Two sequences (xn) and (yn) where sum(xn) and sum(xn +yn) both converge but sum(yn) diverges.A sequence (xn) satisfying 0 ≤ xn ≤ 1/n where sum(((−1)^n)xn) diverges.

Exercise 2.7.5
Prove that the series (1/n^p) converges if and only if p > 1

Exercise 2.7.6
If (an) is bounded, then sum(an) subverges.
All convergent series are subvergent.
If series(|an|) subverges, then series(an) subverges as well.
If series(an) subverges, then (an) has a convergent subsequence.

Exercise 2.7.7. 
Show that if an > 0 and lim(n* an) = l with l = 0, then the series an diverges.
Assume an > 0 and lim((n^2)*an) exists. Show that an converges.

Exercise 2.7.8
If an converges absolutely, then (a^2)n also converges absolutely
If an converges and (bn) converges, then series(anbn) converges.
If an converges conditionally, then n^2 * an diverges.

Exercise 2.7.9
Prove the ratio test

Exercise 2.7.10
Does (2/1)*(3/2)*(5/4)*(9/8)*(17/6)... converge
The infinite product (1/2)*(3/4)*(5/6)*(7/8)*(9/10) certainly converges. (Why?) Does it converge to 0

Exercise 2.7.11
Find examples of two series an and bn both of which diverge but for which min{an, bn} converges. To make it more challenging, produce examples where (an) and (bn) are strictly positive and decreasing.
