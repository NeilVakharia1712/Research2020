Exercise 3.2.5
Prove that a set F ⊆ R is closed if and only if every Cauchy sequence contained in F has a limit that is also an element of F.

Exercise 3.2.6. Decide whether the following statements are true or false.Provide counterexamples for those that are false, and supply proofs for thosethat are true.An open set that contains every rational number must necessarily be all of R.The Nested Interval Property remains true if the term “closed interval” is replaced by “closed set.”Every nonempty open set contains a rational number.Every bounded infinite closed set contains a rational number.The Cantor set is closed.

Exercise 3.2.7. 
Given A ⊆ R, let L be the set of all limit points of A. Show that the set L is closed.Given A ⊆ R, let L be the set of all limit points of A. Argue that if x is a limit point of A ∪ L, then x is a limit point of A.
