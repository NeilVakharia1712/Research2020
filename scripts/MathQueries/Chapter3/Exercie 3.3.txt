Exercise 3.3

Exercise 3.3.1
Show that if K is compact and nonempty, then supK and inf K both exist and are elements of K.

Exercise 3.3.2
Decide which of the following sets are compact. For those that are not compact, show how Definition 3.3.1 breaks down. In other words, give an example of a sequence contained in the given set that does not possess a subsequence converging to a limit in the set.
N.Q ∩ [0, 1].The Cantor set.{1 + 1/22 + 1/32 + · · · + 1/n2 : n ∈ N}.{1, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, . . .}.

Exercise 3.3.3
show that if a set K ⊆ R is closed and bounded, then it is compact.

Exercise 3.3.4
Assume K is compact and F is closed. Decide if the followingsets are definitely compact, definitely closed, both, or neither.K ∩ Fclosure(F' ∪ K')K\F = {x ∈ K : x /∈ F}closure(K ∩ F')

Exercise 3.3.5
Decide whether the following propositions are true or false. If the claim is valid, supply a short proof, and if the claim is false, provide a counterexample.The arbitrary intersection of compact sets is compact.The arbitrary union of compact sets is compact.Let A be arbitrary, and let K be compact. Then, the intersection A ∩ Kis compact.If F1 ⊇ F2 ⊇ F3 ⊇ F4 ⊇ · · · is a nested sequence of nonempty closed sets, then the intersection of Fn /= 0

Exercise 3.3.6
Every ___ set has a maximum.
If A and B are ___, then A+B = {a+b : a ∈ A, b ∈ B} is also ___.
If {An : n ∈ N} is a collection of ___ sets with the property that every finite subcollection has a nonempty intersection, then intersection An is nonempty as well.

Exercise 3.3.8
Let K and L be nonempty compact sets, and define d = inf{|x − y| : x ∈ K and y ∈ L}. This turns out to be a reasonable definition for the distance between K and L.(a) If K and L are disjoint, show d > 0 and that d = |x0−y0| for some x0 ∈ K and y0 ∈ L.(b) Show that it’s possible to have d = 0 if we assume only that the disjoint sets K and L are closed

Exercise 3.3.9 
Assume K satisfies (i) and (ii), and let {Oλ : λ ∈ Λ} be an open cover for K. For contradiction, let’s assume that no finite subcover exists. Let I0 be a closed interval containing K.(a) Show that there exists a nested sequence of closed intervals I0 ⊇ I1 ⊇ I2 ⊇· · · with the property that, for each n, In ∩ K cannot be finitely covered and lim |In| = 0.(b) Argue that there exists an x ∈ K such that x ∈ In for all n.(c) Because x ∈ K, there must exist an open set Oλ0 from the original collection that contains x as an element. Explain how this leads to the desired contradiction.

Exercise 3.3.10
Consider the special case where K is a closed interval. Let {Oλ : λ ∈ Λ} be an open cover for [a, b] and define S to be the set of all x ∈ [a, b] such that [a, x] has a finite subcover from {Oλ : λ ∈ Λ}.(a) Argue that S is nonempty and bounded, and thus s = supS exists.(b) Now show s = b, which implies [a, b] has a finite subcover.(c) Finally, prove the theorem for an arbitrary closed and bounded set K.

Exercise 3.3.11 
Consider each of the sets listed in Exercise 3.3.2. For each one that is not compact, find an open cover for which there is no finite subcover.

Exercise 3.3.12
Using the concept of open covers (and explicitly avoiding the Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem), prove that every bounded infinite set has a limit point.

Exercise 3.3.13
Let’s call a set clompact if it has the property that every closed cover (i.e., a cover consisting of closed sets) admits a finite subcover. Describe all of the clompact subsets of R.
