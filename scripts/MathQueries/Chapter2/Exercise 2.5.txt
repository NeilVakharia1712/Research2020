Exercise 2.5

Exercise 2.5.1. 
Give an example of each of the following, or argue that sucha request is impossible.A sequence that has a subsequence that is bounded but contains no subsequence that converges.A sequence that does not contain 0 or 1 as a term but contains subsequences converging to each of these values. 
A sequence that contains subsequences converging to every point in the infinite set {1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, . . .}. 
A sequence that contains subsequences converging to every point in the infinite set {1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, . . .}, and no subsequences converging to points outside of this set.

Exercise 2.5.2. 
Decide whether the following propositions are true or false, providing a short justification for each conclusion.If every proper subsequence of (xn) converges, then (xn) converges as well.If (xn) contains a divergent subsequence, then (xn) diverges.If (xn) is bounded and diverges, then there exist two subsequences of (xn) that converge to different limits.If (xn) is monotone and contains a convergent subsequence, then (xn) converges.

Exercise 2.5.3. 
Prove that if an infinite series converges, then the associative property holds. Assume a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 + a5 + · · · converges to a limit L (i.e., the sequence of partial sums (sn) → L). Show that any regrouping of the terms (a1 + a2 + · · · + an1) + (an1+1 + · · · + an2) + (an2+1 + · · · + an3) + · · · leads to a series that also converges to L.
Compare this result to the example discussed at the end of Section 2.1 where infinite addition was shown not to be associative. Why doesn’t our proof in (a) apply to this example?

Exercise 2.5.4
The Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem is extremely important, and so is the strategy employed in the proof. To gain some more experience with this technique, assume the Nested Interval Property is true and use it to provide a proof of the Axiom of Completeness. To prevent the argument from being circular, assume also that (1/2^(n)) → 0. (Why precisely is this last assumption needed to avoid circularity?)

Exercise 2.5.5. 
Assume (an) is a bounded sequence with the property that every convergent subsequence of (an) converges to the same limit a ∈ R. Show that (an) must converge to a.

Exercise 2.5.6.  
show lim b^(1/n) exists for all b ≥ 0 and find the value of the limit.

Exercise 2.5.7
Extend the result proved in Example 2.5.3 to the case |b| < 1; that is, show lim(bn) = 0 if and only if −1 < b < 1.

Exercise 2.5.8
Find examples of sequences with zero, one, and two peak terms. Find an example of a sequence with infinitely many peak terms that is not monotone.
Show that every sequence contains a monotone subsequence and explain how this furnishes a new proof of the Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem.

Exercise 2.5.9
Let (an) be a bounded sequence, and define the set S = {x ∈ R : x < an for infinitely many terms an}. Show that there exists a subsequence (ank) converging to s = supS. (This is a direct proof of the Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem using the Axiom of Completeness.)
