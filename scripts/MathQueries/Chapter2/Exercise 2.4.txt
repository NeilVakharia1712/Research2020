Exercise 2.4

Exercise 2.4.1
Prove that the sequence defined by x1 = 3 and xn+1 =1/4 − xn converges
Now that we know lim xn exists, explain why lim xn+1 must also exist and equal the same value.
Take the limit of each side of the recursive equation in part (a) to explicitly compute lim xn.

Exercise 2.4.3
Show that sqrt(2), sqrt(2 * sqrt(2)), sqrt(2*sqrt(2*sqrt(2))) converges and find the limit.
Does the sequence sqrt(2), sqrt(2 * sqrt(2)), sqrt(2*sqrt(2*sqrt(2))) converge? If so find the limit

Exercise 2.4.4
Show that the Monotone Convergence Theorem can also be used to prove the Archimedean Property without making any use of Axiom Of Completeness
Use the Monotone Convergence Theorem to supply a proof for the Nested Interval Property that doesn’t make use of Axiom Of Completeness.

Exercise 2.4.5

Let x1 = 2 and define x(n+1) = 1/2 * (xn + 2/xn). Show that (xn)^2 n is always greater than or equal to 2, and then use this to prove that xn − xn+1 ≥ 0. Conclude that lim xn =sqrt(2).
Let x1 = 2 and define x(n+1) = 1/2 * (xn + 2/xn). Modify the sequence (xn) so that it converges to sqrt(c).

Exercise 2.4.6 (Arithmetic–Geometric Mean).
Explain whysqrt(xy) ≤ (x+y)/2 for any two positive real numbers x and y. (The geometric mean is always less than the arithmetic mean.)Now let 0 ≤ x1 ≤ y1 and define xn+1 = sqrt(xnyn) and yn+1 = (xn + yn)/2 Show lim xn and lim yn both exist and are equal.

Exercise 2.4.7
Let (an) be a bounded sequence. Prove that the sequence defined by yn = sup{ak : k ≥ n} converges.The limit superior of (an), or lim sup an, is defined by lim sup an = lim yn, where yn is the sequence from part (a) of this exercise. Provide a reasonable definition for lim inf an and briefly explain why it always exists for any bounded sequence.Let (an) be a bounded sequence. Prove that lim inf an ≤ lim sup an for every bounded sequence, and give an example of a sequence for which the inequality is strict.Let (an) be a bounded sequence. Show that lim inf an = lim sup an if and only if lim an exists. In this case, all three share the same value.
