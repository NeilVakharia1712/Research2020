Exercise 2.6

Exercise 2.6.1
Prove every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence.

Exercise 2.6.2
Give an example of each of the following, or argue that such a request is impossible.A Cauchy sequence that is not monotone.A Cauchy sequence with an unbounded subsequence.A divergent monotone sequence with a Cauchy subsequence.
An unbounded sequence containing a subsequence that is Cauchy.

Exercise 2.6.3
If xn and yn are Cauchy sequences. Give a direct argument that (xn +yn) is a Cauchy sequence that does not use the Cauchy Criterion or the Algebraic Limit Theorem.
If xn and yn are Cauchy sequences. Give a direct argument that (xn * yn) is a Cauchy sequence that does not use the Cauchy Criterion or the Algebraic Limit Theorem.

Exercise 2.6.4 
If an and bn are Cauchy sequences. Is cn = |an − bn| Cauchy 
If an and bn are Cauchy sequences. Is cn = ((−1)^(n)) * an Cauchy 
If an and bn are Cauchy sequences. Is cn = [[an]] Cauchy 

Exercise 2.6.5
Are Pseudo-Cauchy sequences are bounded.
If (xn) and (yn) are pseudo-Cauchy, then (xn + yn) is pseudo-Cauchy as well.

Exercise 2.6.6
Give an example of a sequence that is quasi-increasing but not monotone or eventually monotone.
Give an example of a quasi-increasing sequence that is divergent and not monotone.
Is there an analogue of the Monotone Convergence Theorem for quasiincreasing sequences? Give an example of a bounded, quasi-increasing sequence that doesn’t converge, or prove that no such sequence exists.

Exercise 2.6.7

Assume the Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem is true and use it to construct a proof of the Monotone Convergence Theorem without making any appeal to the Archimedean Property. This shows that BW, AoC, and MCT are all equivalent.
Use the Cauchy Criterion to prove the Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem, and find the point in the argument where the Archimedean Property is implicitly required.
How do we know it is impossible to prove the Axiom of Completeness starting from the Archimedean Property?
