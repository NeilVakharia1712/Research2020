Exercise 1.3 

Ex 1.3.1
Write a formal definition for the infimum or greatest lower bound of a set.
state and prove a version of Lemma 1.3.8 for greatest lower bounds.

Exercise 1.3.2. Give an example of each of the following, or state that the request is impossible.(a) A set B with inf B ≥ sup B.(b) A finite set that contains its infimum but not its supremum.(c) A bounded subset of Q that contains its supremum but not its infimum.

Exercise 1.3.3. 
(a) Let A be nonempty and bounded below, and define B = {b ∈ R : b is a lower bound for A}. Show that supB = inf A.(b) Use (a) to explain why there is no need to assert that greatest lower bounds exist as part of the Axiom of Completeness.

Exercise 1.3.4. 
Let A1,A2,A3, . . . be a collection of nonempty sets, each of which is bounded above. Find a formula for sup(A1∪A2). Extend this to sup (U Ak k = 1 to n).
Consider sup (U Ak k = 1 to infinity) Does the formula in (a) extend to the infinite case?

Exercise 1.3.5. 
As in Example 1.3.7, let A ⊆ R be nonempty and bounded above, and let c ∈ R. This time define the set cA = {ca : a ∈ A}.(a) If c ≥ 0, show that sup(cA) = c supA.(b) Postulate a similar type of statement for sup(cA) for the case c < 0.

Exercise 1.3.6. 
Given sets A and B, define A+B = {a+b : a ∈ A and b ∈ B}. Follow these steps to prove that if A and B are nonempty and bounded above then sup(A + B) = supA + supB.(a) Let s = supA and t = supB. Show s + t is an upper bound for A + B.(b) Now let u be an arbitrary upper bound for A + B, and temporarily fix a ∈ A. Show t ≤ u − a.(c) Finally, show sup(A + B) = s + t.(d) Construct another proof of this same fact using Lemma 1.3.8.Exercise 1.3.7. 
Prove that if a is an upper bound for A, and if a is also an element of A, then it must be that a = supA.

Exercise 1.3.8. 
Compute, without proofs, the suprema and infima (if theyexist) of the following sets:(a) {m/n : m, n ∈ N with m < n}.(b) {(−1)^m/n : m, n ∈ N}.(c) {n/(3n + 1) : n ∈ N}.(d) {m/(m + n) : m, n ∈ N}.

Exercise 1.3.9. 
(a) If supA < supB, show that there exists an element b ∈ B that is an upper bound for A.(b) Give an example to show that this is not always the case if we only assume supA ≤ supB.

Exercise 1.3.10 
(Cut Property). The Cut Property of the real numbers is the following:If A and B are nonempty, disjoint sets with A ∪ B = R and a < b for all a ∈ A and b ∈ B, then there exists c ∈ R such that x ≤ c whenever x ∈ A and x ≥ c whenever x ∈ B.(a) Use the Axiom of Completeness to prove the Cut Property.
(b) Show that the implication goes the other way; that is, assume R possesses the Cut Property and let E be a nonempty set that is bounded above. Prove supE exists.(c) The punchline of parts (a) and (b) is that the Cut Property could be used in place of the Axiom of Completeness as the fundamental axiom that distinguishes the real numbers from the rational numbers. To drive this point home, give a concrete example showing that the Cut Property is not a valid statement when R is replaced by Q.

Exercise 1.3.11. Decide if the following statements about suprema and infima are true or false. Give a short proof for those that are true. For any that are false, supply an example where the claim in question does not appear to hold.(a) If A and B are nonempty, bounded, and satisfy A ⊆ B, then supA ≤ supB.(b) If supA < inf B for sets A and B, then there exists a c ∈ R satisfying a < c < b for all a ∈ A and b ∈ B.(c) If there exists a c ∈ R satisfying a < c < b for all a ∈ A and b ∈ B, then supA < inf B.
